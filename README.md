# Dashboard.py

Dashboard.py is Bootle-based Python module to provide Dashboard interfaces for web development using the [AdminLTE 
Dashboard](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE). Dashboard.py aims to integrate all  the Bootstrap, Font 
Awesome, JavaScript Charts (such as ChartJS or Morris Charts) that AdminLTE provides into a interactive API. 

## Installation

As it is not yet uploaded to PyPI (soon!), you must download from git and perform the installation *manually*, using 
the `setup.py` way: 

```
git clone https://github.com/isman7/Dashboardpy.git
cd Dashboardpy
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

> *Dashboard.py is almost in its initial development stage.*
> *Dashboard.py is being developed for fun! As a base for further own projects.*
